    "text": "When writing a methodological paper, it is a good idea to make your code publicly available, since it will be much easier for others to use your method on their own data. One way to do this is to create an R package.\nR packages can be complicated, but the easiest way to get started is to make a bare-bones, minimal R package and then add complexity. This article will show you how!\nNote: These instructions are blatantly stolen from Hilary Parker’s article, Karl Broman’s article, Andrew’s slides, and Danni’s teaching materials from BSTA 670. Everything was tested on R version 4.1.3.\n\n\n\n\ndevtools::create()\ndevtools::document()\ndevtools::install()\n\n\n\n\nOur goal is to make a minimal package called pennsive_stuff, consisting of 2 R functions. Suppose these functions are located in two .R files, nl.R and plot_dist.R, containing the following:\n\nnl(): a function that prints new lines in R Markdown documents.\n\n# Contents of nl.R\nnl &lt;- function(){\n  cat(\"  \\n\")\n  cat(\"  \\n\")\n}\n\nplot_dist(): a function that plots the distribution of a variable in a dataset.\n\n# Contents of plot_dist.R\nplot_dist &lt;- function(dat, var_name){\n  stopifnot(var_name %in% colnames(dat))\n  stopifnot(class(dat[,var_name]) == \"numeric\")\n  \n  p &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(dat) +\n    ggplot2::geom_histogram(ggplot2::aes_string(x = var_name), bins = 30, \n                            fill = wesanderson::wes_palettes$GrandBudapest2[1]) +\n    ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n    ggplot2::labs(y = \"Count\", x = var_name)\n  \n  return(p)\n}\nNote that plot_dist() contains dependencies from the ggplot and wesanderson packages.\n\n\n# Run in R\ninstall.packages(c(\"available\", \"usethis\", \"testthat\", \"pkgdown\", \"roxygen2\", \"devtools\", \"covr\"))\n(But how were those packages created?? Ooooo!)\nTo make a super minimal package, you really only need roxygen2 and devtools.\n\n\n\nThis will also check if the name has been taken on CRAN and other sites.\n# Run in R\n# Will look up your package name on CRAN, Bioconductor, and Github\n# Will also check the meaning of your package name on several websites\navailable::available(name = \"pennsive_stuff\", browse = FALSE)\n\n\n\n# Run in R\ndir.package &lt;- [the directory on your computer that you'd like everything to be in]\nsetwd(dir.package)\ndevtools::create(\"pennsive_stuff\")\nThis will automatically create a folder in your working directory called pennsive_stuff:\n# Run in R\nlist.files(\"pennsive_stuff\")\n\nDESCRIPTION has details about your package, which can be edited in an app like TextEdit (Mac) or WordPad (Windows).\nNAMESPACE has the names of the objects in your package that will be made available upon library()ing it. It’s empty right now!\nR is a folder that will hold all of your function .R files.\n\n\n\n\nEach function that you want to include in the package should be in an .R file and placed in the folder pennsive_stuff/R that was created in Step 2. You can have one function per .R file, or organize multiple functions in one .R file. It doesn’t mattter!\nLet’s put the .R files, nl.R and plot_dist.R–which contain the code for nl() and plot_dist() respectively–into pennsive_stuff/R:\n# Run in R. \n# Ensure that the two files, nl.R and plot_dist.R are in pennsive_stuff/R\nlist.files(file.path(\"pennsive_stuff\", \"R\"))\n\n\n\nYou know the nice notes that you see when you do e.g. ?sample? We too can have nice things!\nThe most tedious parts of documentation are taken care of through the Roxygen2 package. All you have to do is add special comments at the start of the .R files that you just copied to /pennsive_stuff/R.\nRoxygen2 documentation is just extra lines added before the functions in the .R files and they look roughly like this:\n#' Short summary of the function\n#'\n#' Description of the function\n#'\n#' @param param_name1 description of parameter/input 1\n#' @param param_name1 description of parameter/input 1\n#'\n#' @return description of what is returned\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' nl()\n#'\n#' @export\n\nThe final line @export adds this function to the NAMESPACE file, so that is accessible (i.e., via pennsive_stuff::nl() or after calling library). Otherwise, you would have to access it through the ::: operator, à la pennsive_stuff:::nl().\nThere are many options for formatting these things (e.g., adding links, equations): see https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/formatting.html.\n\nFor example, after adding documentation to nl.R, the file would look like:\n# Contents of nl.R\n\n#' Print new line in HTML files\n#'\n#' This function prints a new line in HTML files, which is useful when printing other things such as headers or plots.\n#'\n#' @return Returns nothing except some spaces!!\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' nl()\n#'\n#' @export\n\nnl &lt;- function(){\n  cat(\"  \\n\")\n  cat(\"  \\n\")\n}\nFor plot_dist.R, because the function depends on the ggplot2 and wesanderson R packages, we would have an additional line for @import (imports everything in the namespace) and @importFrom (imports only a particular thing).\n# Contents of plot_dist.R\n\n#' Plot Histogram\n#'\n#' Plot the histogram of a numeric variable within a data frame\n#'\n#' @param dat a data.frame containing the data to plot.\n#' @param var_name a character vector of the column name in the data.\n#'\n#' @return a histogram plot.\n#' @import ggplot2\n#' @importFrom wesanderson wes_palettes\n#'\n#' @examples\n#' plot_dist(dat = iris, var_name = \"Petal.Length\")\n#'\n#' @export\n\nplot_dist &lt;- function(dat, var_name){\n  stopifnot(var_name %in% colnames(dat))\n  stopifnot(class(dat[,var_name]) == \"numeric\")\n  \n  p &lt;- ggplot2::ggplot(dat) +\n    ggplot2::geom_histogram(ggplot2::aes_string(x = var_name), bins = 30, \n                            fill = wesanderson::wes_palettes$GrandBudapest2[1]) +\n    ggplot2::theme_minimal() +\n    ggplot2::labs(y = \"Count\", x = var_name)\n  \n  return(p)\n}\n\n\n# Run in R\nsetwd(file.path(dir.package, \"pennsive_stuff\"))\ndevtools::document()\nAfter running document(), you will see some .Rd files automatically generated for you in the man folder:\n# Run in R\nlist.files(\"man\")\n\n\n\n\nThat was it! Easy, right? Now let’s install the package while in the directory containing the pennsive_stuff folder:\n# Run in R\nsetwd(dir.package)\ndevtools::install(\"pennsive_stuff\")\nNow you have the package!! You can call the library command from anywhere (on your computer) now.\n# Run in R\nlibrary(pennsive_stuff)\nnl()\nplot_dist(dat = iris, var_name = \"Petal.Length\")\nAnd you can see the results of the Roxygen2 documentation here:\n# Run in R\n?nl()\n?plot_dist()\nGreat job!\n\n\n\n\nYou have a basic R package; everything else is gravy. Here are some more things you can do with your package:\n\nInclude data.\nUpload to Github, which allows your package to be installed via devtools::install_github().\nUplaod to CRAN or Bioconductor.\n\n\n\n\nSome packages come with data (e.g. refund::DTI) that accompany the functions. Suppose we also want the package to contain the dataset iris2.\nIn the package directory, create a folder called data:\n# Run in R\nif (!dir.exists(file.path(dir.package, \"pennsive_stuff/data\"))) dir.create(file.path(dir.package, \"pennsive_stuff/data\"))\nThe easiest way to save the data in the data folder is to use usethis::usedata():\n# Run in R\nset.seed(382349)\niris2 = iris[sample(x = 1:nrow(iris), size = 100, replace = TRUE),]\n\nsetwd(file.path(dir.package, \"pennsive_stuff\"))\nusethis::use_data(iris2, iris2)\nThen, you’ll need to create an R file named data.R in the R folder, where your other R functions are stored.\nSimilar to the Roxygen2 documentation for functions, the data.R file needs to contain the following:\n# Contents of data.R\n\n#' Edgar Anderson's Iris Data\n#'\n#' This famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) iris data set gives the measurements in \n#' centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, \n#' respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are \n#' Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.\n#'\n#' @docType data\n#'\n#' @usage data(iris2)\n#'\n#' @format \\code{\"iris\"} is a data frame with 150 cases (rows) and 5 variables\n#'  (columns) named Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width, Petal.Length, Petal.Width, and Species.\n#'\n#' @keywords datasets\n#'\n#' @references Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) \n#' The New S Language.

Once you set up a Git repo in your local drive, it’s easy to share it on Github (as easy as anything with Git/Github, anyways…)\n\n\nFirst, cd to the package folder /pennsive_stuff/ in your Terminal and type\n# Run in terminal\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit\nIf you are using RStudio and have opened the project pennsive_stuff.Rproj, you should see a “Git” tab in the Environment, History, Connections tab.\n\n\n\nNext, go to Github and make a new repo with the name as this package, pennsive_stuff. Leave the box for README unchecked!\nYou may need to configure RStudio access to your Github account via a personal access token. Easy instructions here: https://gist.github.com/Z3tt/3dab3535007acf108391649766409421.\n\n\n\nIn terminal,\n# Run in terminal\ngit remote add origin https://github.com/[your github-id]/pennsive_stuff\ngit push origin HEAD:main\nFor more details, see https://andy1764.github.io/Making%20an%20R%20Package/Making-an-R-Package.html#47 and https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/github.html.\n\n\n\n\nThere are many hoops to jump through to put your package on CRAN. CRAN is maintained by volunteers, who manually check your R package (especially if it’s the first submission) in addition to all of the automated checks. https://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/pages/cran.html.\nYou can also put your package on Bioconductor, which is reportedly easier: https://bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/.",

    "text": "Cluster computing used here refers to the use of remote resources for a computation. This contrasts with local computing, the use of a resource such as a personal or laptop/desktop for a computation. An example could be running a script in a programming language (R, Python, etc.); this could be down with either computing type. What benefits are there in using these remote resources? Doing so can provide the following advantages over local computing:\n\nHave multiple computations running simultaneously\nQueue computations to run automatically\nUse more powerful computational resources (more memory, faster CPU, accessing GPUs, etc.)\n\nwhich can make your computations much more efficient, and sometimes feasible when local resources are not sufficient. This can conceptualized with the following diagram:\n\n\n\nwww.esds.co.in\n\n\nwhere your instructions for the computations are sent to a central remote computer from your local computer, node, which then controls how these are sent out to be completed by the other nodes.\nIn this wiki entry, we will go over the basics of how cluster computing works with the resources available at Penn and how to interface with these resources on a fundamental level. More efficient and powerful ways are covered in the “Advanced Cluster Practices” wiki. Both wiki entries will discuss all of this topics in the context of the takim cluster on PMACS, though there are other clusters which you may have access to which operate slightly differently (e.g. CUBIC). Examples here are down in Windows, but Mac or Linux would be very similar."

It is free to use for educational licenses, so members of Penn and other university can use it for free, otherwise you would have to pay. After installing Fetch and opening the program, a window should pop-up where you specify the server you wish to connect to. If one does not pop-up, you can select File and New connection at the top of the Fetch application. The window should look like this:\n\n\n\nFetch New Connection\n\n\nwhere you then fill-in your cluster information (username, password, etc.). Here is an example of a filled-in log-in to the takim cluster:\n\n\n\nFetch New Connection\n\n\nYou can use the heart icon to save the server address as a favorite to easily access again, as well as the keychain to save passwords. Now that you are logged in, a file directory interface for the cluster will pop up, with the folder displayed being the one specified in the log-in by initial folder, usually you home directory on the server. An example on takim:\n\n\n\nFetch New Connection\n\n\nFrom this window, you can open up folders on the server by clicking on them, navigate the folder structure on the server using the Path icon, and upload/download files to and from the cluster by drag-and-drop as you would usually do with a file explorer interface."

    "text": "Interactive Jobs\nAs a motivating example of an interactive job, suppose to do some R programming on a cluster computer. While this might not seem useful since you can program instead on your local computer, interactive jobs can be used to 1) test code on the cluster to make sure it works as expected when you submit the whole set of computations to the cluster and 2) allows to program on-the-fly with a computer likely more powerful then your local computer. You use other programming languages in this way, such as Python, but here we focus on R.\nFirst, we have to start R on the cluster after logging-in. To use, just type in the command R and hit Enter in the command line:\n\n\n\nStarting a R Session\n\n\nThis will open up a session of R on an available cluster node, which we can operate as you usually would with a R terminal. Available nodes are ones which are currently not doing any computations requested by you or other users. The command R will start a default R session, i.e. a version of R denoted as the “default” in the cluster. If you want to use another version of R installed on thr cluster, you would need the corresponding command. If you want to see what software is available and loaded on the cluster (for example, what versions of R are available), use the command module list:\n\n\n\nModule List Command\n\n\nWorking in an interactive R session is identical to running R througn your command line on your local computer or using the R terminal panel in RStudio. To use a GUI-based interface with R interactive R job, see the second set of cluster wikis which discusses Visual Studio Code.\nNow that we have our R session running, we are going to have to deal with 1) working directories and 2) R packages. The default working directory is always your home directory, which you can change using setwd in your R session per-usual. This will let you access files and paths in your R session on the cluster in reference to the working directory with relative path names (or can use absolute path names). R packages are more complicated. By default, a set of R packages has been installed to a central directory on takim which everyone has read access to (can load the packages) but not write access to (cannot install packages). We can use .libPaths() to view this folder’s name and installed. packages() to view which packages these are. It’s a lot of packages, so don’t submit this command only! We look at the first 10 packages by name:\n\n\n\nModule List Command\n\n\nWhat if a package you would like is not installed here? The default library where packages are which users across the cluster can use is not writeable by users. So we need to create our own folder to install packages to and read in when we use R. This is easiest in your File Explorer program (WinSCP or Fetch). For example, we can create a folder in our default home directory on the takim cluster, which only you have read/write access to. For me, the folder’s path is /home/kmdono02/r_packages/ where kmdono02 would be replaced with your username, though you can choose in path you would like. You’ll see below I have a number of installed packages in this folder.\n\n\n\nR Package Directory\n\n\nWhen running R on the cluster, we then have to point to this directory as a libPath so that it knows to look here for a package we may want to load. This can be using the command .libPaths(\"/home/kmdono02/r_packages/\") in your R session/script. We can use the usual library() command in R to load a package installed in the default and added R libPaths\n\n\n\n.LibPaths() Command\n\n\nNow that we have our packages all set up and know how to set our working direcotry, as well as referencing files and folders using absolute and relative path name, we are all set to use the R interactive session on the cluster just like we would if we were running R on our local computer through the R console/terminal. However, we usually don’t rin R through the terminal on our local computer as it is quite cumbersome. Instead we usually use an IDE which is more graphical/user-friendly like RStudio. Luckily we can also use IDE’s to run an R interactive session on the cluster! Two options are RStudio Server and Visual Studio Code (VSCode). VSCode is easier to set up, so we cover how to use it on the cluster in the advanced cluster wiki."

    "section": "Batch Jobs",
    "text": "Batch Jobs\nWhile interactive jobs are very useful, batch jobs in which you send a set of instructions to be carried out remotely by the cluster nodes are a powerful tool and provide the main benefit of cluster computing. These jobs consist of two files: 1) sh file and 2) programming script (R script, Python script). The sh file(s) provide the details about how the job is carried out and then the script provides the computations you want to be done by the nodes. For example, suppose you want to run a linear regression model in R on the cluster? The sh file could provide instructions such as what programming script to run, where to store output on the status of the job from the node, to run a batch job vs array job, etc. In the regression example, suppose we have our R script to run the model in the folder /home/kmdono02/r_scripts/. Then, our sh file could be\ncd /home/kmdono02/r_scripts/ exec R CMD BATCH  --no-save --no-restore run_model.R  ../batch_output/log.out\nThe sh file tells the cluster node two things. First, set the working directory to the folder where the script is stored. Then, run the R script run_model.R in a R session on the node and print the log file to the folder batch_output in the directory /home/kmdono02, with the log file named log.out. The pieces --no-save and --no-restore are just options we can specify to the R CMD BATCH command. Note that these are all just command line commands, equivalent to if we typed these exact lines when we opend the command line in the beginning to interact with the cluster. Putting them in an sh file/script allows us to include a bunch of commands and submit them at once compared to submit each one-by-one, making the process more efficient. These files can also be used to include additional options as hinted at above, but will discuss in the advanced cluster wiki.\nNow that the instructions for our job are all ready, the next step is to actually submit the job to the cluster to be completed. In our sh file-based setup, that means to submit the sh file to the cluster to be completed. For any job, the process is the following:\n\nSubmit job to central node. Job is given a number as an ID in the system, with system specifications provided for the job (max memory, number of CPUs, etc.)\nJob is placed in scheduler, controlled by the central node. On takim, the scheduler is called LSF (though others exist such as SLURM)\nScheduler handles queue of jobs from all users on cluster, depending on order of submission decides which to start\nYour job is next on the queue, central node submits to node to run job\n\nWe go through each process using the linear regression example in R, called run_model.R.\n\nExample\nLet’s consider the following R script:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Suspend running commands to pause script to see it in scheduler (since it runs very fast!)\nSys.sleep(30)\n\n# Run model on iris dataset\nmodel &lt;- lm(Petal.Width ~ Petal.Length + Sepal.Width + Sepal.Length, data = iris)\n\n# Store output as txt file\nsink(file = \"/home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/r_output/model_summary.txt\")\nprint(summary(model))\nsink()\nThen, we can specifcy the sh file for instructions on how the cluster should complete this code, called batch.sh:\n#BSUB -o /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model.out\n#BSUB -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model.err\n\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nexec R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore ../r_scripts/run_model.R  ../output/run_model.out\nThis is similar to file from before, just with some filenames changed and two new lines at the beginning. The lines starting with #BSUB provide the additional instructions to the node for running this job. The options -o and e provide locations to store the output and error files on the LSF-side, which details infomation regarding the node(s) used to complete the job, any errors that occured, etc. To submit this file, we use the following commands in our Command Line after logging into the cluster:\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nbsub &lt; batch.sh\nThe workhorse function for the job submitting process is bsub, which is where you specify the file detailing the submission. The addition of &lt; enables bsub to “parse” your sh file for arguments labled #BSUB, which will automatically be included as options in the bsub command. We could have also removed those two lines from the sh file and included them directly in the bsub call:\nbsub -o /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model.out -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model.err sh batch.sh\nthough the first way is what we use from here on in these wikis. What happens after we run bsub? Recall our job enters the queue. To see the status of jobs we have submitted or are currently running, we use thr bjobs command. Let’s call it after running bsub and see the output:\n\n\n\nViewing queue\n\n\nAs you can, it took a second after the job was submitted, but it shortly showed up to the queue under my username with a job ID and starting running immediatey. This meant there was an open node for my job right when I submitted it. In the event there is not such an opening, it will show with the status PENDING. Finally we can look at our folders to view our output. For model_summary.txt, we see the output we asked for R to print\nCall:\nlm(formula = Petal.Width ~ Petal.Length + Sepal.Width + Sepal.Length, \n    data = iris)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.60959 -0.10134 -0.01089  0.09825  0.60685 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

This format is generalizable for all cases where you want to run a single R script one time. Make sure to specify .libPaths() in your R script if you are using user-installed packages. For running a Python script instead, everything is the same except the use of exec R CMD BATCH. Instead you replace this with python ../py_scripts/run_model.py for example. Requesting an output file from the Python terminal like we did here is a little more complicated as a it must be done in the Python script itself, which we cover in the advanced cluster wiki."

    "objectID": "cluster_intro.html#array-jobs",
    "href": "cluster_intro.html#array-jobs",
    "title": "Cluster Computing",
    "section": "Array Jobs",
    "text": "Array Jobs\nThe last type of job that we cover is an array job. This allows you to submit a sequence of batch jobs simulatenously, which are similar but change in one or more arguments/indices. These jobs are sent to the scheduler at once after submitting one array job, handled like a set of batch jobs of the same size. For example, suppose you have a image processing pipeline to wish to run on an image from 10 subjects. You want to run the same pipeline on each subject, so the code to run on each subject is going to be the same except for reading and writing data based on the subject ID. Instead of writing 10 scripts or writing one script and then submitting 10 separate jobs where we manually specify the subject, can automate it with an array job.\nThe process is the same as with a batch job, in that we will a bsub call, an sh file containing instructions, and then probably some programming language script such as R. The difference is we now have to specify the indices of the array which constitute the array job in the bsub call and sh file. Suppose we want to run our batch job example (linear regression model), but run it on five different sets of data (data_1.csv, …, data_5.csv) where each dataset has outcome y and covariates x1 to x3 (the data sets are simulated from a corresponding linear regression model for illustration). For the bsub call, instead of\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nbsub &lt; batch.sh\nwe would need to call\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nbsub &lt; -J \"[1-5]\" batch.sh\nin our cluster terminal. The use of -J \"[1-5]\" tells the scheduler to create an array job with indices 1 to 5. We can use other types of indices, such as -J \"[2,4]\" which will create an array job with only indices 2 and 4. The way these indices relate to what instructions are completed in your sh is that for each job in the array, the corresponding index becomes a Unix environment variable which you can reference inside of your job. This variable has the name LSB_JOBINDEX, which can you use in your R and Python scripts. However, you will also want to have some way to view logs related to each array job to view any errors or output from the cluster which is specific to that job in the array. Recall before we added in #BSUB -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model.err for example to print out an error log for the submitted job. However, this was suboptimal since there is no job ID attached to it. We knew before what it was related to, since we were only running one sh file with the name run_model. Now that we have an array job which contains multiple jobs (5 for example), we need error logs for each one with a name to reference. Luckily this is very easy, and we have two options. First, recall each batch job receives a numeric ID once it has been submitted by the scheduler. This also becomes an environmental variable which we can access, labeled LSB_JOBID. We can also use the variable %J in our sh file and/or bsub commands to refer to the job ID before run. For example, we can replace the previous #BSUB line in our batch.sh file with #BSUB -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_%J.err to paste in the ID of the given batch job into the file name of that job’s error log and have it be written to our log directory to view. How does this relate to array jobs? Recall an array job is just a sequence of submitted batch job. Thus, each job in our array also gets a job ID to reference, which is contained in LSB_JOBID and %J. However, these IDs are long and not interpretable, what if we just want to refer to the index within our specific array job (job 1, job 2, etc.)? We just use LSB_JOBINDEX and %l respectively instead. We also add in %J or %l to the other #BSUB lines in our sh file, as well as our exec R CMD BATCH call when we specify the Rout filepath.\nLet’s do the regression example with indices 1 through 5. We’ll specify a new sh file, call it batch_array.sh. This sh file will be\n#BSUB -o /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_array_%l.out\n#BSUB -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_array_%l.err\n\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nexec R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore ../r_scripts/run_model_array.R  ../output/run_model_array_$LSB_JOBINDEX.out\nwhere run_model_array.R will be our R script to run the array regression model example. We’ll simulate data within each array job to reflect one of the 5 datasets which we will run the model on, and control them by setting the seed. Thus, run_model_array.R is the following:\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Suspend running commands to pause script to see it in scheduler (since it runs very fast!)\nSys.sleep(30)\n\n# Generate dataset\nn &lt;- 100\ni &lt;- as.numeric(Sys.getenv('LSB_JOBINDEX'))\nset.seed(i)\nx1 &lt;- rnorm(n); x2 &lt;- rnorm(n); x3 &lt;- rnorm(n); errors &lt;- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 0.25)\ny &lt;- 2*x1+3*x2+4*x3+errors\nsimdata &lt;- data.frame(x1, x2, x3, y)\n\n# Run model\nmodel &lt;- lm(y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, data = simdata)\n\n# Store output as txt file\nsink(file = paste0(\"/home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/r_output/array_model_summary_\", i, \".txt\"))\nprint(summary(model))\nsink()\nWe have simulated data from a linear regression model, of sample size 100, with normally distributed errors with standard deviation 0.25 and 3 covariates of mean 0, with their regression parameters being 2, 3, and 4 respectively. We specify the seed with each dataset as the array index, using Sys.getenv('LSB_JOBINDEX'). This reads-in the environmental variable and then converts to it numeric (is character by default in R). We then fit the regression model and then print the output to our output folder with the index included for reference. We can combine this with the above sh file and below terminal commands to run our array job:\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nbsub &lt; -J \"[1-5]\" batch_array.sh\nThe queue is now the following after submitting our array jobs:\n\n\n\nViewing queue\n\n\nLet’s do so and look at the outputs. First, the output file for one of the arrays.\nSender: LSF System &lt;jszostek@silver01&gt;\nSubject: Job 19659506[1]: &lt;[1-5]&gt; in cluster &lt;PMACS-SCC&gt; Exited\n\nJob &lt;[1-5]&gt; was submitted from host &lt;takim&gt; by user &lt;kmdono02&gt; in cluster &lt;PMACS-SCC&gt; at Wed Mar 22 17:46:27 2023\nJob was executed on host(s) &lt;silver01&gt;, in queue &lt;taki_normal&gt;, as user &lt;kmdono02&gt; in cluster &lt;PMACS-SCC&gt; at Wed Mar 22 17:46:27 2023\n&lt;/home/kmdono02&gt; was used as the home directory.\n&lt;/home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts&gt; was used as the working directory.\nStarted at Wed Mar 22 17:46:27 2023\nTerminated at Wed Mar 22 17:47:02 2023\nResults reported at Wed Mar 22 17:47:02 2023\n\nYour job looked like:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\n# LSBATCH: User input\n#BSUB -o /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_array_%I.out\n#BSUB -e /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_array_%I.err\n\ncd /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/batch_scripts\nexec R CMD BATCH --no-save --no-restore ../r_scripts/run_model_array.R  ../output/run_model_array_%I.out\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExited with exit code 1.\nwhich is just a summary of what was submitted for the entire array job and what the exit code was, just like would happen for a batch job.

Then, you could just use #BSUB -o /home/kmdono02/cluster_examples/batch/logs/run_model_array.out to avoid the duplicate files. The R terminal output is stored in ../output/run_model_array_1.out for the first array’s R terminal for example.

    "text": "What is a package?\nIn the same way an R package contains all the functions to complete tasks, Python packages function the same way. There’s two ways of handling this: modules and packages.\nA module is a .py file containing the functions and classes you want to use that you can import into your code. For example, if you had “hello.py” containing the function:\ndef hello(n): \n  for i in range(n): \n    print('hello world') \nYou can import this function into another .py file:\nimport hello\n\nhello.hello(10)\nA package is a group of multiple modules packaged together. Most of the publicly available ones are hosted on PyPI (the Python Package Index), but there are some still in development that are hosted on GitHub. You can install packages from either, as well as develop your own!",

    "text": "Environments (Conda, Pipenvs, etc.)\nThe idea of an environment is important for reproducible programming. An environment can be thought of as the software and packages (with specific version numbers) that you use to code a particular task. For example, using pandas 1.0.2 and numpy 1.4.2 in Python 2.8to write hello.py. This is important for reproducible programming because functions in different package can use different syntax or give slightly different results. Anyone else interested in reproducing your results needs to use the same packages as you to achieve the same results.\nMost environment managers accomplish much the same thing, but some compilers will prefer a particular method (for example, Anaconda compilers function better with conda).\n\nConda\nConda is a generalized environment and package manager that works over many different languages, including Python. Conda can be used to install packages (similar to pip) AND to generate different environments for different codes you want to run or develop. For example, if you wanted to use numpy 1.4.2 for code1.py and numpy 1.2.1 for code2.py, you can create two environments (one for each version) and run each code in its corresponding environment.\nEnvironments can also be shared with others for reproducibility by exporting the .yaml file associated with each environment.\nFor more documentation on the specifics of conda syntax, you can read the conda documentation.\n\n\nPipenv and Venv\nPip and virtual environments are also efficient methods for managing environments and packages.\nVirtualenv or venv (virtual environment) is the lightweight version of pipenv, where you can activate an environment and install packages such that version will be saved in a requirements.txt file for others to use. The only difference between the two is that venv comes with Python3, while virtualenv has to be installed separately.\nPipenv is built on top of pip that allows you to pip install specific packages into an environment, then updates a pipfile with all the packages you’re using. It essentially combines aspects of pip and virtual environments into a single system.",

    "text": "Thank you for considering making a contribution to the PennSIVE wiki! In this article, you will find a streamlined set of steps that you will need to follow in order to contribute your own article to the PennSIVE wiki website.\nThe requirements to follow this tutorial are:\n\nA GitHub account.\n\nHave Quarto installed (comes with the latest version of Rstudio).\nHave Git installed.\n\nBasic markdown syntax knowledge.\n\nIn essence, making a contribution to this Wiki will involve writing or editing Markdown files and running a few git commands to integrate your changes with the existing wiki. Don’t worry you got this!\n\n\nThe first step to collaborate on any project that is hosted on GitHub (e.g., this wiki) involves “forking”. Forking a GitHub repository (or repo for short) allows you to create your own personal copy of a project under your GitHub account. This forking mechanism allows you to back up changes you make to this wiki’s code without affecting the original repository.\nTo fork this wiki’s source code, follow these steps:\n1. Navigate to https://github.com/pennsive/pennsive.github.io while logged in to GitHub.\n2. Click Fork on the upper right hand corner. \nAfter forking, you can check your personal copy of the wiki’s source code under this URL: https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/pennsive.github.io.\n3. Then, clone your copy of the repository from GitHub onto your local machine. In a Terminal, run:\ngit clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/pennsive.github.io\nThis will create a folder called pennsive.github.io at the location where you run this command.\n\n\n\nGitHub allows you to have remote copies of your git repositories. By convention, your personal remote copy of a git repository is called origin. For projects you do not own (e.g., forked projects), there is one more remote copy that you should track: the original repository, which by convention is called upstream.\nTo track the original PennSIVE wiki repository as the upstream repository, you can run:\ncd pennsive.github.io # to get into the project folder\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/pennsive/pennsive.github.io.git\nTracking the upstream repo will allow you to incorporate incoming changes while you work on your contribution article. Find more details on how this is done in this article [TODO: link to section in git article]\n\n\n\nTo keep your work organized, you will use a branch. A branch is essentially an alternative version of your repository. For more details check the git article [TODO: add link].\ngit checkout -b &lt;yourusername&gt; # if you're making multiple contributions, work on each in a separate branch and give each one a specific name\nTechnically, you could work on the main branch instead of creating another branch for your work. However, branches allow you to incorporate changes easily in the event the main branch of the upstream changes (see rebasing [TODO: add link]). And you will need to be in sync with upstream when contributing your own work. So be safe: use branches.\n\n\n\nOnce you are in your own branch——check that the terminal shows your branch name within parentheses——you’re ready to make changes.\nIn Rstudio, create a Quarto Document (i.e. a file with .qmd extension).\n\n\n\nCreating a Quarto Document\n\n\nThe first line of your document should be a top-level header with ‘#’. This header will be the title of your article, which shows up in the navigation bar of the website. Note that you should not have a YAML section in your document as it is commonly found in Rmarkdown/Quarto documents. For illustration purposes, suppose your document is named article.qmd with a header # Doing cool stuff. Then your newly created document would look like this:\n# Doing cool stuff\nTo add the article to the navigation bar, edit the file _quarto.yml by adding the line - article.qmd under the contents section of the sidebar section. It will look something like this (... represents omitted content):\n# ...\nwebsite:\n# ...\n  sidebar: \n    # ...\n    contents:\n      # ...\n      - article.qmd\n      # ...\nOnce you have added your article to the list of articles in _quarto.yml as described, you can preview the site by running quarto render in the command line OR by pressing the render button in Rstudio. Note: you need the latest version of Rstudio, which comes with Quarto, to use the latter method. \nRendering will create (or update) .html files found under the docs/ directory: these files are the actual content that is viewed in a browser. After rendering, open docs/index.html in a browser and navigate to your article using the sidebar. Voila - A preview of your own version of the PennSIVE wiki! \nOnce you’re familiar with the rendering process, it’s time to generate some content!\nWrite out your contribution article using markdown syntax, version control your work throughout if possible, and follow the next step when you’re ready to submit your work.\n\n\n\nWe will follow a common Git workflow to incorporate our changes to the live wiki. Before commiting your files, make sure you have rendered and previewed the results (there should be changes to the docs/ directory if you run git status)\n\n\nFirst you need to make sure all your work is safe by committing it. To commit [TODO: add link] your work, first add your file to the staging area [TODO: add link].\ngit add article.qmd docs/article.html # replace 'article' by your file name\nThen, add all other files that have been updated, this will include the _quarto.yml file .\ngit add -u # -u adds files that are already tracked in the repo and that have been modified\nOnce all the necessary files are in the staging area, go ahead and commit. Note: make sure that you are in your own branch and NOT on the main branch.\ngit commit -m 'some descriptive message'\nBack up your changes to GitHub before continuing:\ngit push origin &lt;your-branch&gt; \n\n\n\nYou will need to incorporate any changes made to the wiki that may have happened after you forked. To check if changes have been made to the wiki, you need to fetch the metadata from the upstream repository.\ngit checkout main # you should not have uncommitted work before switching to main\ngit fetch upstream main\nOnce the metadata has been fetched, check if your main branch is up to date\ngit status\nIf the resulting message says ‘up to date’ you can skip to (TODO: submitting a pull request). If not follow this process:\ngit pull upstream main\ngit checkout &lt;your-branch&gt;\ngit merge main\nThese three commands will (1) update your main branch to match what is in the original repository you once forked, (2) merge the updated changes from the main branch to &lt;your-branch&gt;. You may need to resolve merge conflicts [TODO: add link] which falls out of the scope of this. However, here’s some additional resources (TODO)\n\n\n\nAfter merging potential updates to the wiki as described above (or if that step was not needed), you can go ahead and push the final version of your work to GitHub.\ngit push origin &lt;your-branch&gt;\nOnce that is successful, navigate to your GitHub account and start a Pull Request. In your copy of the repository, you will see a green button to start a pull request. As an example, here’s the pull request for the article you are currently reading.\n\n\n\nStarting a pull request\n\n\nClicking on the Compare & pull request will take you to a page in the PennSIVE repo where you can describe your edits. Check that the name of your branch appears on the right (see underlined) and the main branch of the PennSIVE repo on the left. Then, include a descriptive summary of your proposed changes/additions. Finally, hit ‘create pull request’.\n.\nOnce you have submitted your pull request, the site maintainer will review your changes and either accept them or ask for more edits. The status of the pull request will be publicly visible on the PennSIVE repo. If more edits are required, make more commits to your branch, push them to your repo, and these changes will appear in your pull request.\n\n\n\nPull Request Submitted\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou have made a contribution to the PennSIVE wiki and made the world a better place!"

    "text": "When labs organize datasets in different ways time is often wasted rewriting scripts to expect a particular structure. BIDS solves this problem by standardizing the organization of neuroimaging data. BIDS is nothing more than a prescribed directory structure and file naming convention, but it allows labs to more easily share datasets and processing pipelines, interact with the dataset programmatically via pybids, and run all the most popular neuroimaging tools (“BIDS Apps”) in a consistent way.\nAlthough it’s possible to manually organize NIFTIs into the BIDS structure, doing so is error-prone and inefficient. Manual organization may be the only option if dicoms aren’t available, but otherwise you can use heudiconv to automatically format the produced NIFTIs according to BIDS.\nUnlike dcm2niix which can simply be fed a directory of dicoms, heudiconv requires a bit more setup.

    "text": "When labs organize datasets in different ways time is often wasted rewriting scripts to expect a particular structure. BIDS solves this problem by standardizing the organization of neuroimaging data. BIDS is nothing more than a prescribed directory structure and file naming convention, but it allows labs to more easily share datasets and processing pipelines, interact with the dataset programmatically via pybids, and run all the most popular neuroimaging tools (“BIDS Apps”) in a consistent way.\nAlthough it’s possible to manually organize NIFTIs into the BIDS structure, doing so is error-prone and inefficient. Manual organization may be the only option if dicoms aren’t available, but otherwise you can use heudiconv to automatically format the produced NIFTIs according to BIDS.\nUnlike dcm2niix which can simply be fed a directory of dicoms, heudiconv requires a bit more setup. First, your dicoms be organized either by StudyUID or accession_number. Then, you need to run heudiconv with the -c none -f convertall options to generate TSVs with dicom metadata needed to write a heuristic.\nFor example,\nheudiconv \\\n    -d \"/path/to/data/{subject}/{session}/*.dcm\" \\\n    -o /path/to/output \\\n    -f convertall \\\n    -s 001 -ss abc -c none -b -g accession_number\nThere will now be a hidden .heudiconv directory with dicom header TSVs.

If you’re using python you can use a rpy2-based wrapper and be able to keep parameters that represent NIFTI images in memory. If you’re building a neuroimaging pipeline in python with Nipype, we have a fork with our tools called PennSIVEpype.

    "text": "Nipype workflows\nMany neuroimaging tools have idiosyncratic CLIs that are clumsy to use from programming languages like python and R. Nipype provides a unified interface that facilitates the design of workflows within and between packages, lowering the learning curve necessary to use a new package.\nNipype interfaces consist of an input and output specification class, _run_interface method, and _list_outputs. To validate inputs are the requested type and outputs get created correctly, nipype uses a package called Traits to automate much of the process. When the .run() method is called on an instance of your interface, the _run_interface method is called, and _list_outputs is used to list the files matched against the output specification. For example, an interface that simply moves a file might look like\nclass MoveResultFileInputSpec(BaseInterfaceInputSpec):\n    in_file = File(exists=True, desc='input file to be renamed', mandatory=True)\n    output_name = traits.String(desc='output name string')\n\n\nclass MoveResultFileOutputSpec(TraitedSpec):\n    out_file = File(desc='path of moved file')\n\n\nclass MoveResultFile(BaseInterface):\n    input_spec = MoveResultFileInputSpec\n    output_spec = MoveResultFileOutputSpec\n\n    def _run_interface(self, runtime):\n        shutil.copyfile(self.inputs.in_file, self.inputs.output_name)\n        return runtime\n\n    def _list_outputs(self):\n        outputs = self._outputs().get()\n        outputs['out_file'] = self.inputs.output_name\n        return outputs\nA slightly more complex example, which thresholds an input image with nibabel might look like:\nfrom nipype.interfaces.base import BaseInterface, \\\n    BaseInterfaceInputSpec, traits, File, TraitedSpec\nfrom nipype.utils.filemanip import split_filename\n\nimport nibabel as nb\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\n\nclass SimpleThresholdInputSpec(BaseInterfaceInputSpec):\n    volume = File(exists=True, desc='volume to be thresholded', mandatory=True)\n    threshold = traits.Float(desc='everything below this value will be set to zero',\n                             mandatory=True)\n\n\nclass SimpleThresholdOutputSpec(TraitedSpec):\n    thresholded_volume = File(exists=True, desc=\"thresholded volume\")\n\n\nclass SimpleThreshold(BaseInterface):\n    input_spec = SimpleThresholdInputSpec\n    output_spec = SimpleThresholdOutputSpec\n\n    def _run_interface(self, runtime):\n        fname = self.inputs.volume\n        img = nb.load(fname)\n        data = np.array(img.get_data())\n\n        active_map = data &gt; self.inputs.threshold\n\n        thresholded_map = np.zeros(data.shape)\n        thresholded_map[active_map] = data[active_map]\n\n        new_img = nb.Nifti1Image(thresholded_map, img.affine, img.header)\n        _, base, _ = split_filename(fname)\n        nb.save(new_img, base + '_thresholded.nii')\n\n        return runtime\n\n    def _list_outputs(self):\n        outputs = self._outputs().get()\n        fname = self.inputs.volume\n        _, base, _ = split_filename(fname)\n        outputs[\"thresholded_volume\"] = os.path.abspath(base + '_thresholded.nii')\n        return outputs\nWhen writing workflows, most of the time a tool will already have an interface, see the nipype interfaces index for a complete list. A workflow will typically begin by parsing command line arguments\nparser = argparse.ArgumentParser()\nparser.add_argument('-i', '--input', type=str, default='T1W.nii.gz')\nparser.add_argument('-o', '--output', type=str, default='/tmp/tmp')\nargs = parser.parse_args()\nsetup a workflow and interface node:\nwf = Workflow('threshold')\n\nthresh_phase = Node(SimpleThreshold(), 'thresh_phase')\nthresh_phase.inputs.volume = args.input\nthresh_phase.inputs.threshold = 0.5\nthen another node, connected to the first\nmove_phase = Node(MoveResultFile(), 'move_phase')\nmove_phase.inputs.output_name = args.output\nwf.connect([(thresh_phase, move_phase, [('out_file', 'input_image')])])",

To run a non-interactive job, run qsub -o /path/to/stdout -e /path/to/stderr -b y -cwd -l h_vmem=16G -pe threaded 4-8 ./my_job.sh. -b y tells SGE you’re running a binary executable, -cwd makes the directory you issue the command from the working directory for the job, -l h_vmem=16G sets memory (default is only 4G!), and -pe threaded 4-8 gives your job anywhere from 4-8 CPU cores depending on what the scheduler decides.",

Using datalad save is useful when initially moving source data into a repository, but is otherwise an anti-pattern since files will be created or modified by scripts, which you want to run through the datalad run wrapper. Although it is possible to run your scripts then save the results with datalad save afterwords, running your code with datalad run is preferred because it automatically checks to make sure inputs are available, unlocks and saves outputs, as well as commits the command line used to do the processing so results can be reproduced in an automated way.

Datalad uses git submodules to relate your parent dataset to its subdatasets, which record the path to the subdataset and which commit it’s on. So when committing changes in subdatasets, you will need to make a commit in every parent dataset that you want to update the commit it’s on (datalad save’s -r flag is useful for this).\nSince datalad monitors all files for changes parallelizing datalad run commands can be difficult as datalad doesn’t know which files correspond to which runs.

    "text": "Random numbers are useful for many things in statistics but computers are deterministic machines so random number generators (RNGs) can only generate numbers that “look” random, i.e. have an even distribution. Each time a RNG is invoked it deterministically extracts a number from its initial state (i.e. seed) then deterministically updates its state so that it will be different on the next call. Therefore setting a seed is not thread-safe; without external memory synchronization, it’s plausible two threads could generate the same or different random numbers depending on if one thread sees the update to the internal RNG state made by the other thread. Sometimes the multi-threading speedup outweighs the risks of race conditions, but when reproducibility is important you should use a single thread. Most neuroimaging tools (including ANTS, FSL, Freesurfer) can be configured to use 1 thread by setting the following environment variables:\nexport ITK_GLOBAL_DEFAULT_NUMBER_OF_THREADS=1\nexport OMP_NUM_THREADS=1\nexport OMP_THREAD_LIMIT=1\nexport MKL_NUM_THREADS=1\nexport OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1\nBIDS apps that use ANTS, FSL, etc also usually provide a command line-option to run deterministically on one thread. For example, fMRIprep and sMRIprep have a --skull-strip-fixed-seed argument which ensures run-to-run replicability when used with --omp-nthreads 1 and matching --random-seed &lt;int&gt;.\nWhen writing multithreaded R code, reproducibility can be achieved by setting the RNGkind to L'Ecuyer-CMRG:\nRNGkind(\"L'Ecuyer-CMRG\") # Without this line setting a seed won't work in multithreaded code\nset.seed(1)\nparallel::mclapply(1:2, function(n) rnorm(n), mc.cores = 2)\nPython, on the other hand, does not need a special kind of RNG:\nfrom multiprocessing.pool import Pool\nimport numpy as np\n\nnp.random.seed(1)\np = Pool(2)\nprint(list(p.map(np.random.normal, range(2))))\n\n\nAnother cause of variance in scientific computing has to do with the limited precision of floating-point numbers. Since humans use a base-10 system, fractions that don’t use a prime factor of the base (e.g. 1/3, 1/7, and so on) can’t be expressed cleanly; in decimal form, these would be repeating decimals. On the other hand, computers use binary (base-2) and since the only prime factor is 2, you can only cleanly express fractions whose denominator has only 2 as a prime factor. For a computer, 0.1 + 0.2 often doesn’t equal 0.3 exactly because when you perform math with re peating decimals you have precision errors. For examples of 0.1 + 0.2 in a variety of languages, see: 0.30000000000000004.com. Note that these results are dependant on a number of factors, however, including CPU architecture, compiler or underlying system libraries, the use of single or double precision, and multi-threading (via race conditions that change the sequence of floating-point operations). Strategies to mitigate the error such as compensated summation exist, but at the cost of performance.\n\n\n\nBeing able to reproduce results exactly is important in science, but as Brian Avants discusses, forcing run-to-run reproducibility simply “hides the uncertainty intrinsic to the problem.” Moreover, if different random numbers cause large differences in the output of your application then there are other issues you should worry about. Furthermore, there is a bias-variance tradeoff. As a method can either be too simple (high bias, low variance) or too complex (low bias, high variance), but not more complex and less complex at the same time, the tradeoff in complexity means there is a give and take between the bias and variance of a particular method. For example, when registering images sampling the grid in a perfectly regular manor results in estimation bias. Randomness can help reduce this bias, but at the cost of variance.",

    "text": "This short tutorial will help introduce some ideas regarding workflow and code management that can help keep your projects organized by:\n\nMaintaining local and remote copies of project in sync.\nKeeping only one version of the project visible, while having previous version available.\nAllowing collaboration with others on coding projects (this wiki!).\nEnabling you to make parallel, independent changes to your projects (see branching).\n\n\n\nIf you’re working on solo projects, you will often start a repository (i.e. a version-controlled directory or folder) from files you have on your computer. Let’s create a mock project, for this tutorial. I To start a new git repository, navigate to the root directory of your project and run the following command:\nmkdir git_demo\ncd git_demo\ngit init\nThis command will create a new subdirectory named .git inside your project directory, which will contain all the necessary files for Git to start tracking changes to your project. You don’t need to worry about what is inside this directory as you won’t be interacting with its content directly. But if you ever it\n\n\n\nIt’s good practice to have your code backed up in a remote repository. We will use GitHub for that purpose so make sure you have a GitHub account before reading on. We need to create a remote repository on GitHub and associate it with the local repo we initialized.\nOn GitHub, create a new repository. Then add it as a remote with the following command:\n# run this inside the git_demo directory\n# in general, every git command should be run inside your git repo\ngit remote add origin &lt;remote repository URL&gt;\nThe default name for your own remote copy of a git project is origin. You can check the name and the URL remote repository you’ve added by running:\ngit remote -v\n\n\n\nTo check the status of your repository, use the following command:\ngit status\nThis command will show you 1. what branch you’re on (more on branches later but the default branch is main) 2. how many commits ahead or behind you are compared to origin 3. what files your have in the “staging area” (see below) 4. untracked files\nRight now, since there are no changes, so you should see something like this\n#&gt; On branch main\n#&gt; \n#&gt; No commits yet\n#&gt; \n#&gt; nothing to commit (create/copy files and use \"git add\" to track)\n\n\n\nThe staging area is where files are grouped before committing them to the project’s history. Let’s make a file and try git status again:\ntouch README.md\ngit status\n#&gt; On branch main\n#&gt; \n#&gt; No commits yet\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Untracked files:\n#&gt;   (use \"git add &lt;file&gt;...\" to include in what will be committed)\n#&gt;         README.md\n#&gt; \n#&gt; nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\nYou can add this file to the staging area by specifying the (relative) path (just as git tells you on the output above)\ngit add README.md\nRunning git status again:\n#&gt; On branch main\n#&gt; \n#&gt; No commits yet\n#&gt; \n#&gt; Changes to be committed:\n#&gt;   (use \"git rm --cached &lt;file&gt;...\" to unstage)\n#&gt;         new file:   README.md\n\n\n\nOnce your changes are in the staging area, you can commit them to your local repository using the following command:\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\" # or any other message\nThe syntax -m (for message) denotes the title of the commit. Using the -m option is often what you want, as it avoids having to open an editor to write the message and is therefore quicker.\nIn general, your commit messages should be helpful and describe the changes you are making to your project. Think strategically here.\n\n\n\nYou can use a .gitignore file to specify files or directories that Git should ignore when tracking changes. To create a .gitignore file:\ntouch .gitignore\nNote that for R projects, there’s the use_git function from the usethis package which creates a .gitignore file that ignores common R workflow files. By running\nRscript -e \"usethis::use_git()\"\nwe can create a .gitignore that looks like this:\n.Rproj.user\n.Rhistory\n.Rdata\n.httr-oauth\n.DS_Store\nAlso, let’s say we have some data (PHI) and we don’t want to keep track of it: - (1) because uploading PHI data to GitHub would constitute a violation of HIPAA (!!) - (2) because data files are often too large and don’t often change\nTherefore, we can add the data directory to our .gitignore:\n.Rproj.user\n.Rhistory\n.Rdata\n.httr-oauth\n.DS_Store\ndata/\nSuppose we ran jobs on the cluster. Let’s also ignore .log files that are produced when running scripts wrapped in the bsub command\n.Rproj.user\n.Rhistory\n.Rdata\n.httr-oauth\n.DS_Store\ndata/\n**.log\nThe ** matches files ending in .log regardless of what subdirectory they are in.\n&lt;!–&gt; Continue here: 1. create a .log file by running an .R script 2. git add . (adds log) 3. unstage 4. add **.log to .gitignore 5. git add . 6. git commit –amend –no-edit (for initial commit) &lt;–&gt; Before we commit these changes, let’s make sure we know how to “unstage” files. Following git’s suggestion in the output above, we run:\ngit rm --cached log\nTo add all changes in the current directory and subdirectories, except deletion use\ngit add -u\nIf you want to edit the commit message of the most recent commit, use\ngit commit --amend --no-edit\n\n\nWhen git commit is run, it opens an editor, usually vim, where you can write a commit message. The following are the basic commands for vim:\n\nTo start writing a commit message, press i to enter “Insert mode”.\nTo save and exit, press Esc (which enters normal mode) and then type :wq and press Enter.\nTo exit without saving changes, press Esc and then type :q! and press Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!–&gt; Insert gitcreds with use this &lt;–&gt;\n&lt;!–&gt; github tokens with usethis&lt;–&gt;\n\n\n\nSometimes, you may need to switch branches or work on something else without committing your changes. In such cases, you can use the git stash command to temporarily save your changes without committing them. To stash your changes, use the following command:\ngit stash\nYou can apply the changes later by using the git stash pop command:\ngit stash pop\n\n\n\nTo view the commit history of your repository, use the following command:\ngit log --oneline\nThis will display a list of all the commits in the repository, with each commit on a new line and its SHA-1 hash and commit message.\n\n\n\nTo pull changes from the remote repository to your local repository, use the following command:\ngit pull\nThis will fetch the changes from the remote repository and merge them with your local repository.\n\n\n\nThere may be times when you need to undo commits that have already been pushed to the remote repository. You can use the git reset command to do this.\nTo reset to a specific commit, use the following command:\ngit reset &lt;commit SHA-1&gt;\n&lt;!–&gt; add details about SHA &lt;–&gt;\nTo reset the entire branch to the state of the remote branch, use the following command:\ngit reset --hard origin/&lt;branch&gt;\nTo unmodify the files but keep the changes in the working directory use:\ngit reset --soft\nThat’s it! These are the basic commands you’ll need to use Git effectively on a minimal project. Remember to always check the status of your repository, add changes to the staging area, and commit your changes frequently.\n\n\n\nOne of the powerful features of Git is the ability to work with branches. A branch is a separate line of development, which allows you to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously without affecting the main branch.\nTo create a new branch, use the following command:\ngit branch &lt;branch name&gt;\nThis will create a new branch with the specified name.\nTo switch to a different branch, use the following command:\ngit checkout &lt;branch name&gt;\nThis will switch to the specified branch and make it the current branch.\nTo merge changes from one branch to another, use the following command:\ngit merge &lt;source branch&gt; &lt;target branch&gt;\nThis will merge the changes from the source branch into the target branch.\n\n\n\nRebasing is a way to integrate new changes from one branch into another branch. It allows you to reapply your commits on top of the updated upstream branch. It is useful when working with branches that are frequently updated by other team members.\nTo rebase a branch, use the following command:\ngit rebase &lt;upstream branch&gt;\nThis will rebase the current branch onto the specified upstream branch.\nIt is important to note that rebasing can cause conflicts if the upstream branch has changes that conflict with your local commits. In such cases, you will need to resolve the conflicts before continuing the rebase."

It is useful when working with branches that are frequently updated by other team members.\nTo rebase a branch, use the following command:\ngit rebase &lt;upstream branch&gt;\nThis will rebase the current branch onto the specified upstream branch.\nIt is important to note that rebasing can cause conflicts if the upstream branch has changes that conflict with your local commits. In such cases, you will need to resolve the conflicts before continuing the rebase."

    "text": "Image processing software is notoriously challenging to install and manage due to the extensive dependencies they have on different libraries and other software packages. To address this, the field has developed a strong reliance on containerization, which is the practice of packing operating systems, libraries, and software into portable containers that can be shared (and are stable and less affected by system upgrades). There are two main systems we employ for containerization: Docker and Apptainer (formerly Singularity).\nDocker is widely used as a base for the development and use of containers. However, many high-performance computing environments use a system called apptainer as an alternative. Luckily, containers built using Docker are easily converted and run using apptainer. We use Apptainer extensively on the PMACS LPC as well as other systems.\n\n\nOver the years, our center has developed many image processing methods and software implementing these. To facilitate their sharing, and to simplify training new members of the community, we have assembled Docker containers with everything necessary to get started with image processing. These are distributed via Docker Hub but also are available directly on the cluster. Please note that these convenient packages contain openly available software from other developers that may be subject to licensing and use restrictions. The neurodocker effort (https://github.com/ReproNim/neurodocker) was key to the development of our containers. While for some time we used a container called “neuror” available on the pennsive Docker Hub page, our current versions of a container are simply called “pennsive” and are avaiable at https://hub.docker.com/repositories/russellshinohara and on the PMACS LPC in /project/singularity_images.\nWe currently have two types of containers: the base containers, pennsive_amd64 and pennsive_arm64, and the torch-enabled containers, pennsive_amd64_cputorch and pennsive_amd64_gputorch. The two base containers are nearly identical except for their expected chip architecture; the pennsive_arm64 container is for use on Apple Silicon computers, and the pennsive_amd64 version is for use on the cluster. The torch-enabled versions are for use on intel/AMD-architecture machines including our clusters, and we have both a CPU version (for standard queues) and a GPU version (for use on the pennsivegpu queue).\n\n\n\nAs our group is Mac-centric, the following instructions are provided for use on a Apple Silicon-based Apple running Mac OS. However, if we are using a Linux-based laptop (or Windows, untested), we can employ similar commands using the amd64 base container (pennsive_amd64).\nAs step zero, we need to install Docker Desktop which is available on the Docker website.\nFirst, to use a container we need to figure out which parts of your laptop’s filesystem you want it to be able to access. By default, this includes very little - so when you run the container and enter into your turn-key environment for image processing… there are no images to process, and there is nowhere to save your output. To fix this, we need to “bind-mount” locations in your computer’s (the host system) to places in the container’s file system. Suppose I want to mount my desktop.\nNext, we open a terminal. As we don’t yet have the docker container we need, which is pennsive_arm64, we need to pull it. We can do this with docker pull russellshinohara/pennsive_arm64. Next, we can run our container by simply writing:\ndocker run -it --rm --platform linux/arm64 \\\n  --mount type=bind,source=\"/Users/$USER/Desktop\",target=/desktop \\\n  russellshinohara/pennsive_arm64\nThis command will run the container and give you a new prompt to do your coding within the container (and using all it’s installed tools). And, you’ll be able to easily access the files on your desktop on the host machine (your laptop), but they won’t be in /Users/$USER/Desktop but rather in /desktop. You can provide multiple –mount arguments to bind several different host machine directories (as is often necessary).\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use a container on the cluster, things are about as simple after logging into a compute node.\nFirst, let’s talk about the base image. To use this to conduct image processing, we need to first log into the cluster submit node, takim2. Once we’re there, we can select an appropriate queue for our processing. Unless we’re using deep learning methods, this is usually one of the standard queues. In interactive mode, this involves something like:\nbsub -Is -q taki_interactive \"bash\"\nAnd we need to load Apptainer:\nmodule load apptainer\nThen, we can run the container on the compute node with a simple call, and a bind mount:\napptainer shell \\\n  --bind /project/myproject:/project_folder \\\n  /project/singularity_images/pennsive_amd64.sif\nEt voila! We can access R, etc.\n\n\n\nIf we want to use or develop deep learning methods, we need access to a GPU. To do this, we can use our GPU queue:\nbsub -Is -q pennsivegpu -gpu num=1 bash\nAnd we need to load Apptainer:\nmodule load apptainer\nAnd then, we can run with the –nv flag:\napptainer shell --nv \\\n  --bind /project/myproject:/project_folder \\\n  /project/singularity_images/pennsive_amd64_torchgpu.sif\nAnd similarly, now we can run deep learning methods interactively.\n\n\n\nUsing a container for a batch job is just as easy. We only need to put that apptainer call into the script we run when we submit the job (with bsub) and everything will be wrapped up nicely. However, in batch mode we don’t need an interactive shell to work with; we just need apptainer to run a container. For example, we may want to run a shell script that has a command like:\napptainer exec --nv \\\n  --bind /home/rshi/testdata/sub-001_T1w.nii.gz:/in/t1.nii.gz \\\n  --bind /home/rshi/testdata/out:/out \\\n  /project/singularity_images/hd-bet-0.3.0.sif \\\n  hd-bet -i /in/t1.nii.gz -o /out/t1_stripped.nii.gz\nThis will take in a file testdata/sub-001_T1w.nii.gz in my home directory, and run HD-BET on it using Phil Cook’s container. It will then output a masked brain image in /home/rshi/testdata/out.\n\n\n\n\nIf a problem arises when using a container, the easiest way to approach it is to default back into interactive mode. Often problems involve bind mounted directories where paths become complex. But don’t despair - this is SO much easier than trying to figure out which version of python you need and how to get it installed with the right version of some package you’ve never heard but that’s crucial for the task you need to complete!",

This article will walk you through instructions and examples for using each of them.\nFor each pipeline, usage instructions will be provided with dummy paths and an example path. Clicking the pipeline name will take you to the respective pipeline’s GitHub page.\nNote: some of these pipelines are also available as BIDS apps, with instructions on the PennSIVE pipelines page of this wiki.\n\n\nThe BIDS pipeline converts DICOM images to NIfTI and organizes the files in BIDS format. It uses the heudiconv DICOM converter and an RShiny app for heuristic customization.\n\n\nThis pipeline contains three stages: 1) Heuristic: prepares heuristic template, 2) Customization: launches RShiny app for heuristic customization, and 3) BIDS: runs DICOM to NIfTI conversion and format into BIDS structure.\nThis pipeline must be run through a container, either Singularity on a cluster or Docker locally.

It provides a user-friendly interface where multiple users can collectively assess segmentation quality through interactive features.\n\n\nCluster:\nSys.setenv(CURL_CA_BUNDLE = \"/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.trust.crt\")\nlibrary(devtools)\nnew_path = \"/path/to/save/r_packages\"\n# for example:\n# new_path = \"/home/ehorwath/rpackages\"\nwithr::with_libpaths(new = new_path, install_github(\"Zheng206/BrainQC\"))\n# change the QC_CLI.R Script\n.libPaths(c(\"/misc/appl/R-4.1/lib64/R/library\",new_path))\nLocal:\nlibrary(devtools)\nnew_path = \"/path/to/save/r_packages\"\n# for example:\n# new_path = \"/home/ehorwath/rpackages\"\nwithr::with_libpaths(new = new_path, install_github(\"Zheng206/BrainQC\"))\n\n\n\nThis pipeline contains three stages: 1) QC Preparation: prepares for QC results, 2) Interactive Evaluation: runs interactive QC sessions to evaluate segmentation masks, and 3) Post-QC: reviews QC results interactively.\nThis pipeline can be run with or without a container. For containerized usage, Singularity can be used on a cluster or Docker locally. Step 1 can be run in individual or batch mode, meaning you can specify a certain subject and session or run the pipeline for all subjects in the folder, respectively. Steps 2 and 3 must be run in batch mode.\nThese examples will run the pipeline in batch mode on the cluster. To run individually or locally/with a container, set --mode -individual, or -c local/-c singularity/-c docker, respectively.\n\n\n\nThis step prepares all data for QC app.\n Required flags:\n-m or --mainpath: path to parent data folder -i or --img: brain image name --seg: ROI or lesion mask name --toolpath: path to pipeline folder\nOther flags:\n-p or --participant: participant ID (only needed for individual mode) --step: step of pipeline - prep, qc, post.
